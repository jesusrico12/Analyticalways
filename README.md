# **ACME School Management System**

Welcome to the **ACME School Management System**, a .NET 8 solution designed as an example of a rich, domain-driven implementation. This project was created to showcase a **simple architecture** adhering to **SOLID principles**, with a strong emphasis on **domain modeling** and future scalability. I spent **approximately 5 hours** on this implementation.


----



## **Project Overview**

This project focuses on managing entities like **Students**, **Courses**, and **Enrollments**, while also abstracting external services such as a payment gateway. The solution was intentionally kept **simple**, avoiding overengineering while preparing for potential growth and complexity in future iterations.

### **Key Features**
- Domain-driven design with **rich domain models**.
- Abstractions and interfaces for potential integrations with external services (e.g., payment gateways or databases).
- No coupling with any specific database or third-party service.
- Designed to be **user-friendly, maintainable**, and extensible.


----



## **Key Decisions and Trade-offs**

### **Why a Simple Solution?**
- The current implementation was intentionally designed to focus on **clarity, simplicity, and maintainability**, while adhering to the **SOLID principles**.
- At this stage, introducing advanced concepts like **Clean Architecture** or **Hexagonal Architecture** could lead to unnecessary complexity ("overengineering") for the application's scope.
- This approach allows for **fast iteration** in the early stages and avoids premature optimization.

### **Future Improvements**
As the system grows more complex, the following improvements and patterns could be implemented:

#### **Architecture**
- Introduce **Clean Architecture** or **Hexagonal Architecture** to better structure layers (Domain, Application/Use Cases, Infrastructure).
- Fully adopt **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)** to handle domain-specific complexity.

#### **Design Patterns**
- Use patterns like:
  - **Factory** and **Builder** for complex object construction.
  - **Facade** to simplify external service interactions.
  - **CQRS + Mediator** for clear command-query separation at the Application Layer.

#### **Infrastructure**
- Add **logging tools** like **Serilog** or **OpenTelemetry** for system performance monitoring and observability.
- Use **dependency injection** to manage services and isolate domains effectively.

#### **Functional Improvements**
- Introduce **Monads** (e.g., `Either` or `Option`), ensuring safer error handling and thoroughly managing system states.

#### **Documentation**
- Use **Swagger/OpenAPI** to generate robust API documentation for a potential REST API layer.

## **What Didn’t Make It into This Version?**

There are a number of things I would have liked to implement but decided to leave out for the sake of simplicity:

- **Persistence**: No relational or non-relational database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB) integration is currently used. The current approach allows focus on domain logic without database constraints.
- **Advanced Architectural Practices**: Although these could be helpful as the system scales (e.g., Clean Architecture or DDD), they were not necessary at this stage.
- **Performance Monitoring**: Tools like **OpenTelemetry** for distributed tracing and profiling were not added due to the project’s initial scope.
- **Advanced Design Patterns**: Patterns such as **Builder**, **Factory**, or **CQRS** were not implemented but could be logical additions as system complexity grows.


----



## **What Could Be Improved?**

While the current implementation is functional and adheres to good design principles, there is room for improvement:

1. **Error Handling**:
   - Implementing robust mechanisms like **Monads (Either/Option)** to enforce safer state management and avoid exceptions.
2. **Testing**:
   - Providing more comprehensive tests, including edge cases and integration testing.
   - Adding more **test doubles** (mocks, stubs, and fakes) to simulate behavior in isolated components.
3. **Scalability**:
   - Introducing **logging and monitoring tools** for better observability.
   - Preparing the system for scaling by abstracting infrastructure properly (e.g., repositories, caching layers, etc.).
4. **Modularity**:
   - Splitting the solution into multiple projects to align with architectural guidelines (e.g., separate Domain, Application, and Infrastructure layers).
   - Using dependency injection extensively to isolate and test different layers effectively.

## **Abstractions and Extensibility**

This project emphasizes **creating abstractions** and interfaces to enable flexibility for future integrations. Examples include:

- **Payment Gateway**:
  - Uses the `IPaymentGateway` interface, allowing easy replacement with actual payment services like Stripe or PayPal.
- **Repositories**:
  - Repositories like `IStudentRepository` and `ICourseRepository` abstract the data access logic. These can later be replaced with database-backed implementations.

This ensures that systems are **scalable** and adaptable without requiring significant rework in the future.


----



## **Third-Party Libraries**

The project uses the following libraries:

- **AutoMapper**:
  - Simplifies mapping between domain entities (e.g., `Course`) and DTOs (e.g., `CourseWithStudentsDto`).
- **xUnit**:
  - Provides unit testing capabilities for verifying the correctness of the code.

### **Future Libraries**
In future iterations, the following tools could be added:
- **Serilog**: For structured logging.
- **OpenTelemetry**: For tracing and monitoring system performance.
- **MediatR**: To implement the **CQRS + Mediator** pattern for separating command and query responsibilities.


----



## **Evaluation Criteria**

### **1. Clean Code**
- Implemented with clarity and simplicity in mind.
- Adheres to **SOLID principles** to ensure readability, testability, and maintainability.

### **2. Rich Domain Model**
- The project features entities (`Student`, `Course`, `Enrollment`) with **rich domain logic**.
- Encapsulates domain-specific behavior to keep the code cohesive and extensible.

### **3. Scalability**
- Designed with abstractions to allow easy replacement or addition of external dependencies (e.g., payment gateways, databases).
- Future scalability is planned with flexibility for Clean Architecture and modularity.


----



## **Testing Overview**

The project includes:

- **Unit Tests**: Validates the key behaviors of the system, ensuring the correctness of domain logic.
- **Clear Test Cases**: Tests act as self-documenting examples of the functionality.

### **Future Improvements for Testing**
- Add **integration tests** to validate interactions between components (e.g., repositories and use cases).
- Use test doubles to verify external dependency behavior, such as the payment gateway.


----



## **Summary**

The **ACME School Management System** strikes a balance between **simplicity** and **scalability**. It avoids overengineering while preparing for future enhancements, adhering closely to best practices like **SOLID principles** and **clean code**.

### **Potential Next Steps**:
- Implement advanced design patterns (e.g., Factory, CQRS).
- Introduce database integration and performance monitoring.
- Expand testing and error handling mechanisms.
